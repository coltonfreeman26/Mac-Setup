# Mac Setup
### This project is meant to help with setting up an intel Mac book.

**I work with Containers/Docker images a lot so this will mainly be aimed towards that but not strictly.**

**Setting up Brew**
    Brew is Macs package manager. It makes downloading various tools quick and easy. Brew is open source and anyone can technically contribute a new package to their repository but they are vetted for validity before being accepted.

**Setting up your IDE.**
    I personally like Visual Studio Code the most but there are multiple options out there https://www.keycdn.com/blog/best-ide#which-is-the-best-ide-on-the-market.

    * You can find the download link for VS Code here https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    * Once you have installed VS Code I would suggest also downloading some extras to help make using it easier.
      * Oh My ZSH is a tool that enriches you terminal and is very configurable. https://ohmyz.sh/
      * cmd+shft+p will bring up the prompt for you to search for `Toggle Auto Save` and `Install "code" command in PATH`. Both useful.
      * Exstensions are very usefule for just about any type of work you are doing within VS Code. Some of the ones I use are...
        * Ansible by Red Hat
        * Docker by Microsoft
        * DotENV by mikestead
        * Gitlab Workflow by Gitlab
        * HashiCorp Terraform by HashiCorp
        * json by zainchen
        * Python by Microsoft
        * YAML by Red Hat
        * These are just a few I use, there are a lot as well for spell check, linting, formatting etc. I would advise only using extensions that have a lot of downloads and a high rating.

**Tools I download to make my life easier**
    Programming languages are always useful to have when dealing with Docker images.
